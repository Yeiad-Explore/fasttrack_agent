### Initial Response Decision Logic

**Step 1: Customer Authentication**
```
IF customer provides tracking number OR account info:
    Validate credentials
    Access customer data
    Proceed with personalized service
ELSE:
    Request verification information
    Provide general assistance
    Offer to create account if beneficial
```

**Step 2: Urgency Assessment**
```
IF emergency keywords detected (urgent, emergency, critical, ASAP):
    Escalate priority level
    Reduce response time targets
    Access emergency protocols
ELIF time-sensitive indicators (today, tomorrow, deadline):
    Mark as high priority
    Provide expedited options
ELSE:
    Process as standard priority
```

**Step 3: Complexity Evaluation**
```
IF simple information request:
    Provide direct answer
    Offer additional related services
ELIF moderate complexity requiring system checks:
    Perform necessary lookups
    Provide comprehensive response
ELIF high complexity or multiple issues:
    Break down into components
    Address systematically
    Consider escalation if needed
```

## Tracking Inquiry Workflows

### Standard Tracking Request Flow
```
1. Receive tracking number
2. Validate format and checksum
3. Query tracking database
4. IF found:
     Display current status
     Show delivery timeline

     Check for typos/similar numbers
     Request order details as alternative
     Escalate if still no match
5. Proactively identify potential issues
6. Offer related services (delivery changes, insurance, etc.)
```

### Package Status Interpretation Logic
```
Status: "In Transit"
  → Normal progression, provide ETA
  → If delayed >24hrs beyond estimate, investigate

Status: "Out for Delivery"
  → Provide delivery window
  → Offer live tracking if available
  → Remind about delivery instructions

Status: "Delivered"
  → Confirm delivery details
  → If customer says not received, initiate investigation

Status: "Exception"
  → Explain specific issue
  → Provide resolution steps
  → Set customer expectations
```

### Proactive Issue Detection
```
IF package delayed >48 hours:
    Automatically investigate
    Provide proactive update
    Offer compensation if applicable

IF multiple delivery attempts failed:
    Suggest alternative delivery options
    Offer package hold at facility
    Provide direct customer contact options

IF international package in customs >5 days:
